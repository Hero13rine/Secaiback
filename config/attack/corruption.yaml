# Human-adjustable parameters for corruption robustness evaluation.
#
# Each entry under the "corruptions" section corresponds to the corruption
# name referenced in the user robustness configuration.
#
# Supported fields:
#   severities: A list of positive integers describing the severity levels
#               that will be evaluated for the corruption.
#   parameters: Arbitrary keyword arguments forwarded to the corruption
#               implementation (see metric/object_detection/robustness/corruption.py).
#   description: Optional string that documents the intent of the corruption.
#
# Additional fields can be added as needed; unknown keys will be ignored by
# the evaluation pipeline, which makes this file safe for annotating extra
# metadata for operators.
